# sketching-for-denoising
Code for "Compressive learning for patch-based image denoising" (https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03429102).

Run the file **denoising_fepll/demo_denoising.m** to do the denoising. It is possible to modify the user parameter **Î¼** to get better denoising performance. This work contains parts of code taken from S. Parameswaran, C-A. Deledalle, L. Denis and T. Q. Nguyen, "Accelerating GMM-based patch priors for image restoration: Three ingredients for a 100x speed-up", arXiv.

To learn the prior model, run the file **sketching_m/sk_learn.m**. You will need the matlab toolbox SketchMLbox--A MATLAB toolbox for large-scale mixture learning (https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02960718).
